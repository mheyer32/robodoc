There are three possibilities:

(1) If you have a system that supports auto configuration (most Unix
systems), then use:

  ./configure
  make
  make docall

become root and do

  make install


(2) If your system does not support auto-configuration, then have a
look at  Source/makefile.plain  you can build robodoc with

  make -f makefile.plain 


(3) If you are in a win32 environment with VC++ you can compile it by
creating a new empty console application, adding all the *.c and *.h
files in the Source directory and compiling it.  Or try

  vcvars32.bat
  nmake -f makefile.win32

in the source directory.



Additional documentation is provided in Docs/, in the form of
robodoc.html.  For a good example of how to use ROBODoc see the
ROBODoc source code.  To see what kind of documentation can
generated with ROBODoc, change to Source/ and do a

  make xhtml
  make example

or

  make -f makefile.plain example

or if that fails

  make -f makefile.plain
  make -f makefile.plain xhtml
  make -f makefile.plain example


It assumes you have netscape installed.


If you want to see the LaTeX documentation use
   make xtex
   make texview
   gv ROBODoc_mi.ps


Also have a look at the example makefile in the Docs/ directory.

Have fun,
Frans.
