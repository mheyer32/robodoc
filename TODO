My wish list:

o Improve the support for LaTeX. Instead of a lot of
  individual documents robodoc should create one big
  book with documentation. 
o Fix the man page so that it also looks good with tkMan
o Fix the version and date in the man page.
o Merge the patch with internationalization support.
